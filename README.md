# CQSIGN: Topological Contracted Quantized SIGN Framework
This repository is part of "Affordable Graph Neural Network Framework using Topological Graph Contraction" workshop paper published in MICCAI workshop ([MiLLAND 2023](https://miccaimilland.wixsite.com/milland2023)). This repository contains the main source code for our proposed CQSIGN framework along with other implementation of topological graph contraction on various memory-efficient GNN models (e.g., SIGN, QSIGN, GCN, Cluster-GCN, and GNN AutoScale). However, since some of the included model have different dependencies (e.g., different version of NetworkX), this repository will be organized as follows:
